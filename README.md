# convert
A simple base/BCD/Gray Code/Hamming Converter. Made during college as a quick-and-dirty webpage to convert from things for our x86 assembly class - I used this a lot to check if I was doing something wrong!

## Demo/Webpage
This is hosted on [Github Pages](https://therdas.github.io/convert/) and will also be updated/uploaded to [Utilities](https://www.therdas.dev/utils) whenever I have some time.

## Editing and building
Just clone the repo and run `index.html` in your browser-of-choice.

## Archived
This project is very, _very_ old and has been archived. The current version (if you use this) will continue working - however, I do not forsee updating this. I will be making a new version at the URL above at some point.
